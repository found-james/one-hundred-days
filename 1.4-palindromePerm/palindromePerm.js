/*

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.

Ignore casing and permutations need not be dictionary words.

hints: {
    one: do not find all the permutations,
    two: make you sure know what a string permutation is,
    three: A hash table can provide a result with big O of n - linear time
    four: use a bit vector?
}
